Every year, the company Battlefin hosts a fin-tech networking conference for data buyers and data brokers. In 2019, I won a data science competition hosted by them and had been repeatedly invited annual tech events hosted by the company. I was excited to finally see the Intrepid, being able to check out my favorite airplanes on deck while learning about cool companies. The lectures were excellent.

In 2019 I was honored to be invited as a guest scientist to the <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/6220519">2019 Battlefin data science discovery day at the beautiful Plaza hotel in NYC</a>. <a href="https://www.battlefin.com">Battlefin</a> hosts networking events where data buyers connect with data brokers, which included many people from influential companies such as Point 72, Two Sigma, investment banks, hedgefunds and other Wall Street Honchos. Great food, interesting people and lots of business cards. Check out some of the cool pictures I took;

Keeping in touch with your alumni network is really important for professional development. <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu/event/data-science-day-2019-archive/">In 2019, Columbia had its first data science day which included talks by leaders at Microsoft, top research scientists and other interesting presentations.</a> I was very impressed by some of the innovative ways people use data to study the natural world and build products. Some cool pictures;
